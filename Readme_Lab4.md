## OpenGL Lighting Model Investigation

### Project Overview 
An openGL program investigate the following lighting models :
- First row: the simple model (emission)
- Second row: the ambient model
- Third row: the ambient-diffuse reflection model
- Fourth row: the ambient-diffuse specular reflection model.
The fourth row has an ascending value for the specular reflection coefficient > Investigate the attenuation.


### Additional Callback Functions
- Menu callback: Right click to Reset and Exit
- Mouse callback: Rotate object by mouse, Change lighting direction
- Reshape callback: Resize window
- Keyboard callback: Hit "Q" to exit
